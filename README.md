## 🗣️ What Is Shadowing?
Shadowing is a technique where you listen to audio in your target language and speak along with it simultaneously, mimicking the speaker's pronunciation, rhythm, and intonation as closely as possible.

## 🎯 Key Goals
- Improve pronunciation and accent
- Boost listening comprehension
- Develop natural speech rhythm
- Train your brain to think in the target language

## 🧠 How It Works
- Choose audio: Use clear, native-level recordings (e.g., podcasts, audiobooks, dialogues).
- Listen and repeat: Speak along with the audio without pausing—you’re not translating, just echoing.
- Focus on fluency: Don’t worry about understanding every word at first; the goal is flow and mimicry.
- Repeat regularly: Daily practice builds muscle memory and confidence.

## ✅ Tips for Success
- Start with short, simple dialogues
- Use transcripts to follow along if needed
- Practice in a quiet space or while walking (some learners find movement helps focus)
- Record yourself to track progress

## 🔄 Variations
- Delayed shadowing: Repeat just after the speaker finishes each sentence
- Silent shadowing: Mouth the words without speaking aloud (useful in public settings)
- Chunk shadowing: Focus on repeating phrases or sentences in blocks
